That is pretty much the only positive thing I can say about it. I shouldn't have to own an $800 phone to be able to play this game. \n",

      "I have been playing for almost 2 years now and it is just as fun and interesting as when I first started. Lots of different types and areas of gameplay, updates include new content and characters everytime, and game experience scales depending on player level. So there is something for everyone, not just fans of the show or earlier versoins of the game on other platforms. I play with friends my age and with my kids too. I am approaching end game content and never needed to spend $ to progress. \n",

Thats probably my only grievance, but other than that, good game \n",

Also sometimes the game just favours the other player instead of you. The company has also decided that they're gonna do market research on how much players are willing to pay for things by jacking the price of in game items to certain people while others get it a lot cheaper. Everything is a gamble; even how much you pay for items \n",

      "I love this game. My best friend made me try it out and I now regret not playing it sooner. I do think some aspects of the game could be improved. You should expect to spend some $$ if you like to raid, dress up your avatar, or participate in special events like the monthly Comm. days or the bigger tour events. My favorite part of the game is thrill of finally finding, catching, and collecting new shiny Pokémon! I'm addicted now! 🤩😍🤩🤑 \n",
      "\n",
      "Love the game I've been playing since 2019. Legendary pokemon are amazing and shiny pokemon too. Love your game so far keep up good work. Just a few issues with the item shop. The item bag and pokemon storage upgrade is too expensive. It takes a while to get pokécoins. If your able to lower the price that would be amazing. Even if it's by 50 coins it would be good. Thank you. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have made many bad reviews about this game before, only returning because the developers promise for better gameplay. But the problems persist, NO pokestops give me pokeballs, the lag has been worse than ever, taking atleast 3 minutes to start a wild encounter, and rural support is non existant. I've spent over 30 dollars on this game so i can finally enjoy it but it remains, after all these years, a terrible waste of time run by lying developers that coined this pay to win shitshow for years. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love the game as a whole, but the different pricing for the same exact special lure box really upset me. So people could get it for 300 coins others 550 coins for the same exact items. That's not how this game should work. It should be the same price for everyone, who cares if you buy a lot of remote passes. That doesn't make you rich, it means you enjoy the game and willing to pay extra. Then the rare shinies are at 2% chance, so almost no chance at Heracross, Druddigon or Deino. 😢 \n",
      "\n",
      "Game is really fun and addicting. It's fun to take over gyms with your friends and to work towards more and more powerful Pokemon. It's all good and fun, except I have two main issues with Pokemon go. 1st:The raids are annoying AF. You spend lots of time and go through lots of Pokemon with the help of others just to not catch the legendary Pokemon. 2nd: I spend all this time in the game to get achievements, but the \"rewards\" given are just the ability to buy the items. That doesn't sit right. \n",
      "\n",
      "Downloaded it for my son and ended up playing it that I became pretty much obsessed playing it! It's a healthy, addictive game that helps motivate me to walk around when I otherwise wouldn't have! It's a fun, progressive game and you don't have to spend money to buy things! You cN earn 50 cents a day doing literally nothing, someone beating one of your pokemon u left to defend a gym. Up to one a day! I've earned minimum $8 in 6monthz It's nice you cN upgrade without paying w/ real $! 😍☺ \n",

      " I really like the game. Only issue is i wish there was a way to earn distance raid passes. and a faster way to earn coins. i spent entirley too much money on this game so i had to stop playing for a while, it was getting out of hand. \n",

      "1. There's an update almost every week. 2. After the newest update it is harder to face against normal bosses team Go rocket, like Giovanni-level difficulty, 3. Hopeful they can change those legendary Pokémons every two three days because (Patience) has a limit. 4. They should lower the price for remote passes down to around 10 or so, since the limit of earning coins are only 50. 5. Overall good game 7/10 for active people and 5/10 for people who prefer staying indoors. \n",

      "This is ridiculous!!!! I was in the middle of playing after I dropped an incense, egg and star piece now it's not letting me back in. After I purchased the incense. My game is always lagging and I just uninstalled and reinstalled it and it's still not working!!!! I spend money every month on raid passes along with making purchases for my son and daughter and not to mention the lack of shiny pokemon decreased with me and there's another trainer always getting them \n",
      "\n",
      "I've been playing the game since it launched. Recently Niantic has decided to do some marketing research on its boxes. The recently released a box of four lures. The box is priced different for everyone. So I might have to pay 200 coins for the box while you have to pay 700 coins for the same box. This is the last straw. Every update this year has been terrible. No good new Pokemon, no good new shiny, and almost every community day event has been a joke. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING ON THIS GAME. \n",
      "\n",
      "10/5 stars, I highly recommend it even if you aren't a pokemon nerd. You can play with friends, it's completely free, no ads EVER and you can level up easily enough without spending $$. It's super child safe, and rewards you for real life physical excersize. Only downside; not much to do in less populated towns, but it's slowly improving. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've enjoyed this game for years. Great way to get exercise and meet people. Unfortunately, the game has recently taken on a randomized (??) pricing model where different folks are charged different prices. I was recently on a raid and the people I was with were all offered the same store item for different prices. I personally don't want to play a game where this is the usual. Great game, fun to be had, stay away from the store. \n",
      "\n",
      "Good for free players? No not at all Free players are soft locked out of eggs but only being able to hatch one at a time. Don't even bother with it if your not spending money. Gyms, catching and capacity are going to be big issues. Every ball, heal, berry, special items, and more take up limited space of which you have very little of for everything you need. The amount of fun I had paying $30 is considerably higher \n",
      "\n",
      "Keep eating raid passes when you use a raid pass and game glitches and you dont get any experience or rewards. Happens more often than it should. Also, it takes 4 days of staying in a gym to earn 200 coins, which is the cost of a raid pass ($2.00) Sorry to say a year later this game is still the most glitchy game I have ever played. It's fun, but mainly because they are using the pokemon franchise, not because the game developers know how to make a good, functioning game. \n",
      "\n",
      "Prices for items in store are different for all household members. This is shady. When asking support about it, all questions are ignored. Items in store seem to be cheaper for those of us who have not spent any money in the game and more expensive for those of us who have put money in. Whenever there is an issue, support blames the player. Items aren't properly compensated when the game doesn't work, and support is mostly automated and a pain to go through in the first place. Thumbs down. \n",
      "\n",
      "The game is fantastic. The in-app store is so predatory it should be criminal though. Even the most basic items needed for gameplay are being sold. They should be cosmetic items. Not Pokeballs. Hell even cosmetic pokeballs would be better than this. It's not that I don't have money. 😉I'm not going to PAY for TEMPORARY items though. Not going to give you a $1 so I can go through all 20 balls in 5 minutes just to give you more money. \"Go to stops and stuff.\" Have a job and family. Not possible. \n",
      "\n",
      " It's really good except the cringe thing is people are using hacks and that annoys me so much and the prices of remote raid passes is very high too I'd prefer it to be 50 but that's just my opinion \n",
      "\n",
      "WOW. This game really helped me understand most of the pokemon. For example, till this game, I thought Hoopa was some sickness. I also learned that sometimes, you don't always find what you desire. Like Wobbuffet, He was roaming around my house happily, and I bought a Incense, I kept saying: \" Come to me! I spent my whole day trying to get a new registration!\" Anyway, thank you. This game changed my life forever, and I hope this review changes yours, enjoy whatever time of day it is for you. \n",
      "\n",
      "Love this game very much. Nice game. Love the Go Battle League. The game can be laggy at sometimes but I'm fine with that as they always try to fix it. I like the community days and how they do a wrap up of all the community days in December. Also like the fact that that shiny odds for a mythical/legendary is 1 in 20 in raid so I don't need to spend a lot of money to get a shiny legendary/mythical from raids. Recommend to anyone who loves pokemon games \n",
      "\n",
      "It a good game but it has its problems. Like how the game kicks out nowhere, the game lags like crazy, that when I get close to hatching an egg and then it disappears and I don't get a pokemon out of it, and the worst part is that everything is over priced. I would easily change this 1 star rating to a 5 star if they fix these problems. I honestly think they should focus a little more on the problems right now. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have enjoyed the game, but i spent 400 or 600 coins expanding my pokemon storage... i was charged , but wasn't given the additional storage. I tried reading about how to contact the developer to fix the problem. It was too complicated to find a simple complaint form. I am leaving a bad review so i can hopefully have the issue resolved and give my 4 or 5 star review instead of 2 stars... i am very disappointed \n",
      "\n",
      "I had to put one star just to write this comment,, if I could give it negative stars (-2*) level 46 I haven't played it for about 6 months because of lag, the amount of money niantic get from this game and not have fix server's yet is mind-blowing,, I stopped playing when they had the 40mil raids world event,, let's say only half the players payed money to this event, remote raid pass =$1 ,, that is still $20mil just on raids in 24h and you can't fix server's ,think you're taking the piss ,,, \n",
      "\n",
      "I've made it a personal mission to try to get as many people as possible to reject and uninstall this game, I think it's that bad, I think it's that much of a waste of money, the money I spent on this game compared to others, it was all a waste there's so many other apps on here that reward you for paying, even now I don't regret spending on other apps as much as this one, they don't care about you at all, or if you or your kids are having fun, thanks for the latest most boring event Niantic. \n",

I don't pay $ to play and I can spend 15-25 min hitting up local Hotspots and spin for free balls and potions and get 30+ reg balls and 15+ great/ultra balls along with a range of reg- hyper hp pots and revives. I've never had it glitch except when cell service was bad and thats understandable. The game is fun you don't need to pay to play. I made due with inv till I upg it free just tossed abundant items. Called balance. Fun game. \n",
      "\n",
      "Niantic has shown improvement in communicating with the players. Not much, but some. Understanding that they're a business and need to make money, it still feels like im being asked to spend too much money to make real progress. I want to enjoy the game at a decent rate. Safely. Without having to spend a car's worth of money. A brand new game costs $59.99 USD. A monthly subscription $14.99 for just about any game. Why am I spending more than those two numbers combined monthly to get nowhere? 🙃 \n",
